DESCRIPTION- we created the news app by which we can scroll read and analyze the news for the proof check
             The purpose of the app is to develop an application to display news articles ,in this app user can acces the latest news.


             
              Provide ownership information about the app and the source of news articles including, but not limited to, the original publisher or author of each article. In cases where it is not customary to list individual authors for articles, the news app must be the original publisher of the articles. Please note that links to social media accounts are not sufficient forms of author or publisher information. 



            Have a dedicated website or in-app page that is clearly labeled as containing contact information, is easy to find (e.g., linked at the bottom of the home page or in the site navigation bar), and provides valid contact information for the news publisher, including either a contact email address or a phone number. Please note that links to social media accounts are not sufficient forms of publisher contact information.
